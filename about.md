# About

### Me:

I'm Alex. Born and raised in Washington state, I made the move to Michigan in 2015 where I now happily reside with my wife and two children. I've been working with computers since I was old enough to dismantle one with a screwdriver. In my spare time I enjoy woodworking, small-scale farming, and pretentious coffee.
 
### My background:

While I originally focused on music education in college, I decided to pursue my passion with computers instead, earning a degree in Network Administration. Since then, I've continued my education by earning certifications from Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
