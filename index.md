### What I Do

I'm currently the Director of IT & Corporate Security at [Censys](https://censys.com). 

Security shouldn't be hard and it shouldn't suck. I prefer to build a team that harnesses the know-how of both IT and Security that enables our organization to work efficiently and securely without getting bogged down in the mire of security controls that make it hard to get work done.
